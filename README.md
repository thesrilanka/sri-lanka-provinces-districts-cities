### Installation

To prevent unnecessary errors from occurring, start to import or execute provinces.sql, then districts.sql, and lastly cities.sql


### Usage

**Advantages of latitude and longitude**

* Integrate with Google Maps or any map-related service to show the exact place of the city on the map.
* Find locations within a certain radius of a given latitude/longitude.

**Find nearby locations using the Haversine formula**

Here's the SQL statement that will find the closest locations within a radius of 25 kilometers to the 7.358849, 81.280133 coordinate. It calculates the distance based on the latitude/longitude of that row and the target latitude/longitude and then asks for only rows where the distance value is less than 25, ordering the whole query by distance.

```SQL
SELECT id, name_en, name_si, name_ta, (6371 * ACOS(COS(RADIANS(7.358849)) * COS(RADIANS(latitude)) * COS(RADIANS(longitude) - RADIANS(81.280133)) + SIN(RADIANS(7.358849)) * SIN(RADIANS(latitude)))) AS distance
FROM cities
HAVING distance < 25
ORDER BY distance
```
<em>The above assumes that you have distance in kilometers.  If distance is in miles then replace 6371 with 3959.</em>
